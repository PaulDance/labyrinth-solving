# Labyrinths Solving
### A short study of solving labyrinths with local vision only

As a student in mathematics and physics preparing for last year's entrance exams for a master's degree in computer science, I had a test that involved a sort of research project. The goal was for us to choose a scientific subject to study, choose its objectives, complete and analyze its experiments. I personnally chose to study and compare different methods that allowed one to exit any labyrinth, as large as it may be, without having any prior knowledge about it. The algorithm's are: a [random walk](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Random_walk "Wikipedia article") algorithm (not very interesting), the "left hand method", Pledge's algorithm and Trémaux's algorithm. You will find explanation for those [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maze_solving_algorithm "Wikipedia article") and illustration of Trémaux's [there](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6OzpKm4te-E "YouTube video"). So this repository is the result of my work.

## Contents

In this repository you will find three folders:
1. Code: all the programming stuff and experiments databases
   * Labyrinthes.py: all the basic data format and function to describe, generate and manipulate labyrinths
   * Exploration.py: implementation of the algorithms
   * Animation.py: manual or GUI animation of the execution of the algorithms
   * Extraction.py: production, storing, analysis and complexities estimation of experiments results
   * The rest: databases and their respective creation scripts
2. Images: different renders of execution steps and other illustration media
3. Presentations: the presentation of a few slides I had to make for the exam and a bunch of links to web sites I encountered during my documentation research that might interest you.

#### Enjoy!
